# AzureVMScripts
Collection of scripts to automate the creation and customization of MS Azure Virtual Machines

# BuildVM.sh
This Linux shell script (bash) will automate the process of deploying a VM in Azure. It's decently commented, and should
be easy enough for Beginners to read. Simple changes to declared variables will allow you to customize thigs such as:
+ Resource Group
+ Azure Region
+ Servername
+ OS Type
+ Admin Userame
+ Defining Network Security Group Name (NSG)
+ Creating inbound port rules within the NSG
+ Defining Availability Set Name

This is a basic script, and should be useful as a starting point for your further customization.

If you have any questions or would like to request additional features for this script, feel free to poing me!
